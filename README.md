# Question: How do you implement a bitwise AND of numbers in a given range? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `rangeBitwiseAnd(m, n)` implements a bitwise AND operation on all numbers in a given range from `m` to `n`. The function uses a while loop to continuously right shift both `m` and `n` until they become equal. Right shifting a number in binary representation essentially divides it by 2, hence this process continues until `m` and `n` converge to the same value. The variable `shift` keeps track of the number of right shifts performed. Once `m` and `n` are equal, the function then left shifts `m` by the number of shifts recorded. Left shifting a number in binary representation is equivalent to multiplying it by 2 for each shift. The result of this left shift operation is the bitwise AND of all numbers in the original range. The function then returns this result.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is almost identical to the JavaScript version. The only difference is that TypeScript version includes type annotations for the function parameters and return type. This is a feature of TypeScript that allows for static type checking, which can help catch type-related errors at compile time.

In both versions, the function `rangeBitwiseAnd` takes two numbers as input and returns the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range. It uses a while loop to right shift both numbers until they are equal, then left shifts the result to get the final answer. 

The variable `shift` in JavaScript version is renamed to `i` in TypeScript version, but they serve the same purpose. 

Both versions use bitwise shift operators (`>>=` and `<<`) and increment operator (`++`). The logic and the output of both versions are the same.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution also solves the problem by performing a bitwise AND operation on all numbers in the given range. However, the approach is slightly different from the JavaScript version.

In the JavaScript version, the solution uses a while loop to right shift both numbers until they are equal, then left shifts the result to get the final answer. This is done because the bitwise AND of a range is just the bitwise AND of the two boundary numbers. So, the JavaScript version is essentially finding the common prefix of the binary representation of the two numbers.

On the other hand, the C++ version uses a while loop to continuously perform a bitwise AND operation on the number 'n' and 'n-1' until 'n' is less than or equal to 'm'. This operation effectively removes the least significant 1 from 'n'. Then it performs a bitwise AND operation on 'm' and the final 'n'. This approach is based on the fact that the bitwise AND of a number and its predecessor always turns off the least significant 1 in the number.

In terms of language features or methods, the C++ version uses the bitwise AND operator (&) and the subtraction operator (-), while the JavaScript version uses the right shift operator (>>=), the increment operator (++), and the left shift operator (<<). The C++ version also uses the standard input/output streams (std::cin and std::cout) for user interaction, while the JavaScript version does not have any user interaction.
